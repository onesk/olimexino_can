# olimexino_can
An OLIMEXINO STM32 CAN bus sniffing firmware derived from CANtact

This is probably the ugliest piece of embedded software ever conjured to this world,
and it serves one purpose - to transmit 500 kbit powertrain CAN bus data to USB CDC device
for logging.

One day I will refactor it. Trust me, I will.
